This is the code used to generate [mtgimage.com](http://mtgimage.com/)

The vast majority of images on the website were manually downloaded from CCGHQ and added to the site.

Some however are downloaded from various sites. Here is how to run the downloaders:

Gatherer: node util/downloadImages.js <SET CODE>

Mythic Spoiler Images: node util/downloadMythicSpoilerImages.js <SET CODE>

Note: I don't really provide much in the way of support for running this code. It was never meant to be used for public consumption. I provide all images and zips of images on the [mtgimage.com](http://mtgimage.com/) website.
