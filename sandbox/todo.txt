* Add all tokens and ensure sliver token in M14 is working then e-mail Darek Gołąb

* Crop gatherer images so that they don't have rounded borders. This introduces consistency to the card images.
  For more details see e-mail from: mysterious.mister.p@gmail.com   (reply to him when the feature is added)

* Add a search page (different page) that does the 'instant' search like my mtginstant search engine did, except only search the name of the card and provide data a bit differently, making sure to place emphasis on the link to the cards found (maybe just the links (along with data) and hover shows the image, or maybe show images, hrm)

* Add pre-rendered cardname-bordered.png files that have the correct border around the cards
